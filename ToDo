1
	should not declare a non-static function in a source file
2
	use __FILE__ and/or __LINE__ in openlog
3
	?: in one syslog instead of two syslogs
	fixed in the GDH-Gentoo's code -- for volumes
4
	move the code inside if(volume) and if(mount)
	fixed in the GDH-Gentoo's code -- for volumes
5
	strstr will suppress /home/me/variables too, not only /var
6
	volume = _g_unix_volume_new could leak the underlying object whenever the new code suppresses adding it to the list
	fixed in the GDH-Gentoo's code -- stub
7
	don't need to use a memset then strcat -- just use strcpy
	look at the printf family of functions
	syslog functions take a 'printf'-style format string
	fixed in the GDH-Gentoo's code -- for volumes
8
	const pointer to const char
9
	declare the loop counters in the for loops
	fixed in the GDH-Gentoo's code -- for volumes
10
	move declarations of objects with automatic storage duration close to the the first place they are used
	fixed in the GDH-Gentoo's code -- for volumes
11
	replace the hardcoded lists with reading a text file - the same /etc/fstab or other
12
	what could be moved to separate functions
13
